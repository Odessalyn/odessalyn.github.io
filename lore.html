        <h1>VAROSE</h1>
        <div class="scroll">
          <p> The continent of Varose sits in the center of the world and, being the most civilized lands houses a many
            and
            varied
            species of people all spread across its five kingdoms. The kingdom of Theramite sits to the north along the
            head
            of
            the purple worm mountain range. On the eastern shore rests the kingdom of Calirum hugging the sea of
            monsters. The
            kingdom of Dragons Coast spans across the southern desert. The kingdom of Rivers Reach snakes along the
            river of
            life
            in the east. And finally, the isle of small folk rests a day’s voyage off the western coast.
          </p>
          <p>Since the beginning of time these kingdoms warred and bickered, constantly at each other’s throats in a
            period of
            time referred to as the time before order. It was not until a great and wretched evil was set upon the realm
            that
            the
            kingdoms finally set aside their differences and banded together. That evil came in the form of the
            despicable
            lord of
            rot Vestigos the Litch king. Vestigos rose an army of the dead and spread his evil all across Varose in what
            the
            poets
            of history call the decade of rot, forcing the five kingdoms to come together and face this evil as one
            unified
            army.
          </p>
          <p>For ten years the five kingdoms worked together, under the flag of the Freely Unified Country of Kingdoms
            or
            F.U.C.K., to meet darkness and decay with faith and steel. During the final push of the war F.U.C.K. had the
            upper
            hand on Vestigos with the paladins and clerics of Rivers Reach leading the charge. Victory was all but
            guaranteed
            for
            humanity, until the gods suddenly lost their connection with their disciples. The paladins light faded from
            their
            blades and the clerics prayers left their lips unanswered and the decomposing legions overtook them. In that
            moment of
            weakness, a sigil of strength leapt to the front lines to fend off the undead
          </p>
          <p>As this humble knight put on the greatest display of nobility the realm had ever seen an amber light shot
            from
            the
            heavens and filled his sword with a holy power from an unnamed god. With this power the soldier vanquished
            the
            undead
            army with one blow and he, along with his wife the Epoch Mage, chased the Litch King into the woods before
            the new
            god
            brought down a holy reckoning on the Forest Of Rot so mighty that two miles of thickets were flattened. The
            Knight
            emerged from the woods but without the love of his life. The realm lost its most powerful Mage but gained a
            new
            god
            and a king. The knight, a loyal soldier of Calirum, Ga’leer Abernanth became the king of Calirum, and the
            other
            four
            kingdoms bent the knee, swearing an allegiance to their savor that started 50 years of peace.
          </p>
          <p>After the prostration of the 4 kings Ga’leer had 5 crowns crafted each going to a king with a unique gem
            affixed
            on
            each to distinguish them. Since then the world has become a much smaller place as races began to freely
            mingle and
            mix
            and even created multinational guilds and organizations. The realm has not thrived this much since its
            creation.
            In
            that half a decade the bonds between the kingdoms grew stronger as their faith in the old gods grew scarce
          </p>
          <p>The faith of the people shifted from the gods that failed them to the god that saved them. </p>
          <p>Crucifus the One True God.</p>
